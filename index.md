## **Em,**

I just wanted to greet you happy solar return. The sun has returned to its original position from the moment you were born, for the eighteenth time. The moon was waning crescent when you were born and now the moon shines its brightest with the illuminating full moon. It’s been almost 8 months and you're still the person I think of with every full moon that passes.

> "It's a full moon here tonight, which makes me think of you. Because I know that no matter what I'm doing, no matter where I am, this moon will always be the same size as yours, half a world away." - Dear John (2010)

I contemplated sending this to you because I don’t know how you’d react to this, given the fact that I stopped replying to you for months, and all of a sudden I’m greeting you on your birthday. I know I owed you an explanation but I’ll get to that later. In the meantime, I want to thank you for everything. You’ve always made me feel happy and loved. You are the best thing that could ever happen to me and I want you to know that you’ll always be in my heart, forever and ever. I hope you have a great time today with everyone you love. I’m wishing you the best in life. You deserve the world, the moon, the sun, the whole galaxy, and the entire universe.

You can stop reading here and leave the rest for the other days but it’s all up to you. I don’t want to overwhelm you with everything I have to say and this might cause mixed emotions, so read at your own risk. 
  
The few months that we've been apart have been a journey for me in understanding my own thoughts and emotions. I have spent the first couple of months detaching, denying, and dismissing my emotions but I eventually figured it out a few months ago. I wrote a message for you one night pouring all of my thoughts and emotions and I wanted you to read it. My views and feelings now, may or may not have changed since that time but I still wanted you to read it because you deserve to know what I've thought of during our time apart.

**02/28/22**

*I don't know why I'm writing this in the middle of the night (on a school night even) but I just can't stop thinking about what happened between us. We both know it's my fault. I made the choice to leave and you were left with no choice but to accept the fact that I left. You're probably still confused about why I left and I feel so guilty for not making it clear and not even making an effort to properly communicate. I don't know if you already know this, but I suck at communicating, especially communicating how I feel. I always assumed that things weren't going to work out between us but believe me I really wanted us to work. I guessed that if this wasn't gonna last then might as well end it, which will save us both a great amount of emotional heartbreak. Maybe I was just thinking about my own feelings at that time. I didn't care about what you might feel, I only cared about saving myself from this hypothetical heartbreak.*

*As cruel as this sounds, I wanted to blame you. I wanted to say that it's all your fault for lying to me in the first place. You don't know how that shit affected me. I had to rethink which ones you said to me were actually true. And after that, I became suspicious of every little thing you tell me. I trusted you and I became truthful to you. I was so stupid for not leaving sooner. You even asked me if it was over for us and I was having second thoughts about us but I kept it going because I thought we'll make it work. I tried to forget about it and I was so happy to get to know the real you who's not hiding anything. It was easy for me to forgive you but in the back of my mind, I can still remember clear as day what you did. I really really liked you and I'm so happy whenever I talk to you. You bring out the best in me.*

*I don't usually open up to people but it was so easy for me to open up to you. I never once purposely lied to you. The only time I lied to you was when I told you I trust you. I never fully trusted you since that little incident. There's always a voice at the back of my mind saying that you're probably lying even though you said you won't lie to me again. I'm not blaming you for this even though I want to. I know it's all my fault for always being suspicious about everything. I know for a fact that I am the problem here. I wasn't even looking for anything serious the first time we met. I just wanted something fun that'll spice up my boring summer. You probably didn't know this but my friends and I were joking that I was on my 'hoe phase' and it all stopped when I met you.*

*I didn't want to believe this and I kept on denying it but I really fell for you. I didn't want to admit it because I liked the idea of still not having my first love and reserving it for the person that I'm going to end up with for the rest of my life. But unfortunately, I did love you. And I fucking hate that feeling. I hate that you make me feel things I don't want to feel. You make me really emotional. No one has even made me feel this way and I hate the power you hold over me. You bring out the worst in me.*

*Have you watched "Portrait of a lady on fire"? They did not end up together but the memory of each other remains. They didn't choose the lover's choice but the poet's. Happy endings don't always mean eternal possession of each other. And this doesn't necessarily mean we have a tragic love story. We have the memory of each other. All the happy, fun, and playful moments we had with each other is enough. But I do wish we have more than that. More than just a memory. I'm thinking that maybe in another lifetime we'll be together, but at the same time I'm thinking "Why not in this lifetime?".*

*As much as it was hard for me to detach and let go, I still did it. You have no idea how much that hurt me too. The only way I coped was by denying and denying that I loved you. I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because I'm the real problem here. This may sound awful, but I don't regret leaving you. I just wish I did it sooner than I actually did.*

*It scared me how you understood me more than I understood myself. You knew me more than I knew myself. Maybe I'm just scared that you'll use it against me. Maybe I am selfish for overprotecting my own heart that I didn't even think if I break yours.*

*I'm always hesitant when I tell other people things because I'm scared that they might think I'm annoying and oversharing. But you made me comfortable enough to tell you things that I'm interested in and you don't know how happy that made me feel. You really made me feel like the happiest person.*

*I truly miss you and all of our moments together. Sometimes, I find myself rereading our past conversations, and especially your birthday greeting which makes me cry every single time I read it. I don't know if you still mean all the things you said there, and it's totally fine if you don't feel the same anymore. I won't hold you back from finding your well-deserved happiness and peace of mind.*

*I appreciate literally everything you did. All the effort you put in, all the nice things you said, all the love that you made me feel, and all the time that we spent. It's crazy how that small amount of time can mean a lot. It just proves how it's not all about how long you know someone but how deep your feelings are.*
*But you don't deserve someone who's always not sure about anything. You don't deserve someone who can't make simple decisions. You don't deserve someone who doesn't even know what they're feeling. As much as it hurts me to say this, you don't deserve me. You deserve so much better.*

*I don't want you to think that there's something wrong with you or that I simply don't like you anymore because that's far from the truth. You will always be in my heart and I will always love you, but I just can't have you.*

*I'm writing this because I'm finally accepting the fact that it's not meant to be and we will never be the same as before. Even if we did go back, it'll be so different and the damage is irreparable. So it's best if we just part ways and move on with our lives. I've always thought that I need to forget about you to let go and move on, but I don't need to. I can still have all our memories next to my heart and happily reminisce on what we had and at the same time accept that we're just not meant to be together. I was just a rock in space, lucky enough to burn up in your atmosphere for a moment. It was lovely meeting you and getting to know you. Paalam.*

-------------------

So yeah, I wrote that a couple of months ago. I’ve learned and grown over those months and some parts of my message have changed like when I kept saying that I am the problem and yet I’m not doing anything about it. If it’s my fault then I should be the one to fix it, right? And if the thing that’s holding us back is because I’m this or that, then I should do something about that. If you deserve so much better, then why can’t I do better? I know it’s easier said than done, but that doesn’t mean it’s impossible. I had to learn that every relationship isn’t perfect and I need to stop quitting at the first sign of a challenge. I wish I knew this then, I wish things were different, but then I’m thankful that I learned and became better. Although I’m not entirely sure if I am better. These past few months have been so difficult for me. I don’t sleep on time, I don’t eat on time, I’ve lost every ounce of motivation that I have, and I’ve been overall burnt out and completely lost myself. I’m sorry if I’m oversharing again, it’s not my intention to burden you with my life problems. I’m really hoping that you’re doing so much better than I am, that you’ve been better when I’m gone. 

I can’t help but wonder what could’ve happened if I stayed but then again, I made the decision to leave so I guess I’m in no position to be disappointed about a choice that I chose. It is what it is.
To be clear, I didn’t write this letter with the intention of going back to you. I just wanted to greet you on your special day and I wanted to tell you my thoughts from the past months. I’m not sure what will happen if we did go back together. Will it be the same? Will things change? How different would it be? Most importantly, do you even want to? I don’t want to pressure you in answering this question right away. You also don’t really need to answer this. But I want you to know that I want to. I’m learning to stop rationalizing my emotions and simply feel them at the moment. And my feelings are screaming to be with you again. I totally respect your decision if you don’t want to, considering how awful I’ve been by leaving, by not properly communicating, and everything. I deeply apologize for how I’ve been and I swear I’m learning and I’m trying so hard to be better for you. I must admit, I am curious about what you’ve been up to these past months. At the same time, I miss telling you every little thing that’s happening to me.

**05/03/22**

*I have this sudden urge to talk to you and communicate with you but I’m not necessarily sure if it’s the best for the both of us if I come back. I’ll just give you the closure and the explanation you deserve. But holy shit, I really want you in my life.*

-------------------


That probably sums up how chaotic my mind is. You know damn well that I’m indecisive and I rationalize literally every feeling and every decision I have to make. I don’t know how you put up with how complicated I am and how you still manage to understand me. You are unreal. I’m so lucky to have met you. And like I said, you deserve the world, the moon, the sun, the whole galaxy, and the entire universe.

**Happiest Birthday to my favorite taurus! I love you to the moon and to saturn.**
